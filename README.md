# The Darwin World Simulator

### Description
The program presents a simulation of animals on two
different maps. The animals evolve on their own by copulation, 
depending on their energy and genotype. The animals gain energy 
when they eat grass, but they lose it when they copulate and 
live (each day -1 energy). The maps have a "jungle" in the middle, 
where there is more grass than in other areas of the maps. 
The maps can be also magic, which means they magically create 
"copies" of the existing animals at the moment. The magic happens
when there are less than 6 animals, only a maximum of 3 times. 
The animals' genotype determines the movement of the animal during
the day. The animal can move forward or backward or rotate only 
once during the whole day. The animals have to move if they want
to live. During showing the simulation, next to the maps there 
are plots with some statistics. During the simulation, you can 
pause the simulation and also click on one of the animals to 
track them and to see their statistics.


### Background
The project was made for object-oriented programming classes conducted at 
the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krak√≥w at the Faculty 
of Computer Science, Electronics and Telecommunications in the field 
of Computer Science.

### How to run
The class that starts the program is called "World" and is located in 
the 'Darwin-World-Simulator/src/main/java/agh/ics/oop/' folder.

### Technologies
Java 14 + JavaFX 17
